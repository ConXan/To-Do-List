# To-Do List

## A simplified, command-line To-Do list / Task Manager.

Welcome to my first project (ever). This was built primarily for practice, also serving as a hands-on way for me to delve deeper into the C programming language (and Makefile!). 
At its core, this to-do list provides you with a simple list tracking your tasks (up to 999!!), using file I/O.
More specific, you can:

* Add a task to the list,
* Remove a task from the list,
* Update the task's status (mark DONE), or its description,
* Print the whole list,
* Undo/takeback last action

## Usage example

Here are some screenshots showcasing the functionality of the project:

2. Random list, with the third task completed

3. Deletion of the 2nd task from the previous example

## Installation

### Prerequisites

For all platforms, having installed the GNU C Compiler (gcc) is obligatory. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from the official GNU website or install it via your package manager.
Also having downloaded Makefile and Git will make the whole process way more straightforward.

### 1. Linux 

**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone
